## Reward Scoring System Implementation

### Transaction Volume (8 points)
- ✅ $10,000+: 8 points
- ✅ $5,000+: 6 points
- ✅ $1,000+: 4 points
- ✅ $100+: 2 points
- ✅ < $100: 0 points

### Smart Contract Calls (8 points)
- ✅ 500+ calls: 8 points
- ✅ 250+ calls: 6 points
- ✅ 100+ calls: 4 points
- ✅ 50+ calls: 2 points
- ✅ < 50 calls: 0 points

### Unique Wallets (4 points)
- ✅ 100+ wallets: 4 points
- ✅ 50+ wallets: 3 points
- ✅ 25+ wallets: 2 points
- ✅ 10+ wallets: 1 point
- ✅ < 10 wallets: 0 points

### Reward Tiers
- ✅ **Diamond** (17-20 points): $10,000
- ✅ **Gold** (14-16 points): $6,000
- ✅ **Silver** (11-13 points): $3,000
- ✅ **Bronze** (8-10 points): $1,000
- ✅ **Contributor** (4-7 points): $500
- ✅ **Explorer** (1-3 points): $100
- ✅ **No Tier** (0 points): $0

## Usage Instructions

### Web Interface
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Visit the Protocol Rewards dashboard:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/protocol-rewards
   ```

### API Usage
#### Collect Metrics
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/near-protocol-rewards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "collectMetrics",
    "startDate": "2023-01-01",
    "endDate": "2023-01-31"
  }'
```

#### Get Account Info
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/near-protocol-rewards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "getAccountInfo"
  }'
```

## Testing Results

All tests are passing:
- ✅ HD Wallet Derivation tests
- ✅ Bulk Operations tests
- ✅ On-Chain Metrics Collection tests
- ✅ Protocol Rewards Calculation tests
- ✅ Protocol Rewards Dashboard Component tests

## Security Considerations

1. ✅ **Private Key Management**: Private keys are stored securely in environment variables
2. ✅ **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information is stored in `.env.local`
3. ✅ **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints implement proper rate limiting
4. ✅ **Input Validation**: All API inputs are validated
5. ✅ **Error Handling**: Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages

## Future Enhancements

1. **Off-chain Metrics**: Integrate GitHub activity tracking
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Add more detailed metrics and visualizations
3. **Automated Rewards**: Implement automatic reward claiming
4. **Multi-account Support**: Track metrics for multiple accounts
5. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections for real-time metrics
