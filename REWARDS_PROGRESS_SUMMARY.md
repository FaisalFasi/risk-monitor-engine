# NEAR Protocol Rewards Progress Summary

## Transactions Executed Successfully

You have successfully executed multiple on-chain transactions:

### First Batch (5 transactions):
1. `3GaPA5Am3aA7UHy5jESCyr26WgfY62XfGFqDwrDzFW5A`
2. `BK4nLNpu7955MJxBKyesPczDQTtGgR2DFsWJqwYKedSH`
3. `AcDosdBZRh6FU1UHVJzBS416KCFZXN9Gtve2YXnjwQPr`
4. `4rWvLGA8nfDkywixBtLzNhS11FixEFAdc8MuXatTWu8P`
5. `AFywJvGW68TvE6cq5Ez3XuvWoMk9CfMxj7ULquXofU62`

### Second Batch (at least 3 transactions):
1. `3ojbtWoRfz1rePTHrbpE7VTtWuizRWu2oYitqDawhWie`
2. `JE6ctLaT34F3Ymq2riJ15uJUbRhA181i7SyTewfaM4cf`
3. (Possibly more, depending on how many completed before interruption)

## What's Happening to Your Tokens

All transactions are **self-transfers** - sending NEAR from your account `bctemp.near` back to `bctemp.near`:

- **Amount sent per transaction**: 0.001 NEAR
- **Network fees per transaction**: ~0.001 NEAR (gas fees)
- **Net cost per transaction**: ~0.001 NEAR
- **Purpose**: Increase on-chain activity metrics for rewards

## Current Progress Toward Reward Tiers

Based on your transactions so far:

| Tier | Required | Your Progress | Status |
|------|----------|---------------|--------|
| Explorer | $100+ volume, 50+ calls, 10+ wallets | ~$0.008 volume, ~8 calls, 1 wallet | ❌ Not Met |
| Contributor | $500+ volume, 100+ calls, 25+ wallets | ~$0.008 volume, ~8 calls, 1 wallet | ❌ Not Met |
| Bronze | $1,000+ volume, 250+ calls, 50+ wallets | ~$0.008 volume, ~8 calls, 1 wallet | ❌ Not Met |
| Silver | $5,000+ volume, 500+ calls, 100+ wallets | ~$0.008 volume, ~8 calls, 1 wallet | ❌ Not Met |
| Gold | $10,000+ volume, 1,000+ calls, 200+ wallets | ~$0.008 volume, ~8 calls, 1 wallet | ❌ Not Met |
| Diamond | $25,000+ volume, 2,500+ calls, 500+ wallets | ~$0.008 volume, ~8 calls, 1 wallet | ❌ Not Met |

## How to Reach Higher Reward Tiers

To earn meaningful rewards, you need to significantly increase your on-chain activity:

### 1. Increase Transaction Volume
- Execute 10,000+ small transactions (0.001 NEAR each)
- This would generate ~$10-25 transaction volume depending on NEAR price

### 2. Increase Smart Contract Calls
- Use token swaps instead of simple transfers
- Each swap involves multiple contract calls

### 3. Increase Unique Wallets
- Use the HD wallet derivation feature to create 100+ wallets
- Execute transactions from each wallet

## Next Steps

1. **Continue executing transactions** with longer delays to avoid rate limiting
2. **Use the full transaction executor** that can derive multiple wallets
3. **Monitor your progress** through the NEAR Protocol Rewards dashboard

The tokens aren't disappearing - they're being used to pay for network fees to generate the on-chain activity needed for rewards!
