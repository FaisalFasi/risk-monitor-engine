# READY TO EXECUTE NEAR PROTOCOL REWARDS TRANSACTIONS

You have successfully prepared all the necessary components to execute real transactions for earning NEAR Protocol Rewards. Here's what you need to know:

## What We've Prepared

1. **Complete Transaction Execution System**:
   - Real transaction executor (`real-transaction-executor.ts`)
   - Configuration verifier (`verify-configuration.ts`)
   - Demo script (`test-transaction-execution.ts`)

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Example configuration file (`EXAMPLE.env`)
   - Updated package.json with execution scripts

3. **Windows-Specific Tools**:
   - PowerShell script (`run-rewards.ps1`)
   - Batch script (`run-rewards-demo.bat`)

4. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive execution guide (`EXECUTION_GUIDE.md`)
   - Simple demo script (`simple-demo.js`)

## How to Execute Transactions

### Option 1: Using npm Scripts (Cross-platform)

1. **Verify your configuration**:
   ```
   npm run verify-config
   ```

2. **Execute real transactions**:
   ```
   npm run execute-rewards
   ```

### Option 2: Using Interactive Scripts (Windows)

1. **PowerShell script**:
   ```
   .\run-rewards.ps1
   ```

2. **Batch script**:
   ```
   run-rewards-demo.bat
   ```

## Before You Execute Real Transactions

### 1. Update Your Environment Configuration

Edit `.env.local` with your real NEAR account credentials:

```env
# For real rewards (mainnet)
NEAR_NETWORK_ID=mainnet
NEAR_NODE_URL=https://rpc.mainnet.near.org
NEAR_WALLET_URL=https://wallet.near.org
NEAR_HELPER_URL=https://helper.mainnet.near.org
NEAR_ACCOUNT_ID=your-real-account.near
NEAR_PRIVATE_KEY=ed25519:your-real-private-key
```

### 2. Ensure Sufficient Funds

Make sure your account has enough NEAR tokens for transaction fees:
- Estimated cost: ~10 NEAR for 10,000 transactions
- Check your balance before execution

### 3. Start with Testnet (Recommended)

For your first execution, use testnet to verify everything works:

```env
# Testnet configuration
NEAR_NETWORK_ID=testnet
NEAR_NODE_URL=https://rpc.testnet.near.org
NEAR_WALLET_URL=https://wallet.testnet.near.org
NEAR_HELPER_URL=https://helper.testnet.near.org
NEAR_ACCOUNT_ID=your-testnet-account.testnet
NEAR_PRIVATE_KEY=ed25519:your-testnet-private-key
```

Get testnet tokens from the [NEAR Testnet Faucet](https://near-faucet.io/).

## What Happens During Execution

1. **Wallet Derivation**: 100+ unique wallets are derived from your seed phrase
2. **Transaction Planning**: 10,000+ transactions are planned across all wallets
3. **Execution**: Transactions are executed in batches with error handling
4. **Monitoring**: Progress is displayed in real-time
5. **Metrics Collection**: On-chain metrics are collected for rewards calculation

## Requirements for Maximum Rewards (Diamond Tier)

To earn the maximum $10,000 reward:
- ✅ Transaction Volume: $10,000+ (8 points)
- ✅ Smart Contract Calls: 500+ (8 points)
- ✅ Unique Wallets: 100+ (4 points)

Our system automatically achieves all these requirements.

## Monitoring Your Progress

1. **Dashboard**: Visit http://localhost:3000/protocol-rewards
2. **API**: Use the `/api/near-protocol-rewards` endpoint
3. **Logs**: Check console output during execution

## Security Reminders

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: 
- Never share your private keys
- Store `.env.local` securely (not in version control)
- Start with small amounts for testing
- Monitor your account during execution

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check console output for error messages
2. Verify your configuration with `npm run verify-config`
3. Run the demo script to understand the process
4. Consult the documentation in `EXECUTION_GUIDE.md`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Update `.env.local` with your real credentials
2. ✅ Run `npm run verify-config` to verify setup
3. ✅ Execute `npm run execute-rewards` to start earning rewards
4. ✅ Monitor progress on the Protocol Rewards Dashboard

You're now ready to execute real transactions and earn NEAR Protocol Rewards!
